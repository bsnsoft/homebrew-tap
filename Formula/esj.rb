# A draft of a Homebrew formula for the native executable, for a tap of this
# project. It is not submitted anywhere, and the two values a release fills in
# are marked: the owner of the repository the archives are attached to, and the
# checksum of each archive, which dist/package.sh writes beside it as a
# <archive>.sha256 file and a release attaches with the archives.
